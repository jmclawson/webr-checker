    "text": "R can save variables\nAny old calculator can add and multiply. A fancy calculator can also save values to a variable name. And here we‚Äôre talking of variables that are fancier than any you remember from algebra, where ‚Äúx‚Äù and ‚Äúy‚Äù ruled the day. In R, your variable names can be much fancier.\nTo save variables, we‚Äôll use the less-than symbol (&lt;) and the hyphen or minus sign (-) together to make a left-pointing arrow: &lt;-. This means we‚Äôre saving whatever is on the right of the arrow into the variable named on the left. For instance, the following code saves the value ‚Äú1803‚Äù to the variable we‚Äôre creating called louisiana_purchase:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you save a variable, it‚Äôll look like nothing has happened. But with any variable, we can type its name again to see what values are saved in it. Type louisiana_purchase below to retrieve the value saved under that name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nPut your code in the box, run it, and then check it.\n\n\nWhere am I looking? Write some code above. When you‚Äôre ready, run it, and then check it.\n\n\nYee-haw! ü§† Yep, looks right to me. You should be proud of yourself!\n\n\nNo, that‚Äôs not right. Give it another go. Remember to re-run any changes before you check.\n\n\n\nNow you try\nThis example is obviously pretty simple. But we can imagine a scenario where we have two variables or objects that might change over time, while the calculation stays the same. Let‚Äôs say, for instance, that we know that a double-spaced page can hold about 300 words, and we have ten pages to read. We‚Äôd figure out the total number of words with the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut what if the page is single-spaced, and we have 15 pages to read? Using the next code chunk, figure out how many words that is.

Say for instance, you‚Äôre the judge of a contest for ‚Äúcutest dog,‚Äù and you want to weigh every puppy when it gets entered. It may be enough just to have a list of weights listed together.\nIn R, we call this list of values a ‚Äúvector.‚Äù (We‚Äôll often use this word interchangeably with the word list, but it‚Äôs maybe better to use vector because the other word also has other meanings in R.) And we can save the list like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that a vector needs three components:\n\nThere‚Äôs a c at the front.\nParentheses surround everything.\nValues are separated by commas.\n\nAs with saving any variable, it‚Äôll look at first like nothing has happened, but we can type the variable name again to see what values are saved in it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nNow you try\nThe following definition of a vector with four values has some problems with it.
